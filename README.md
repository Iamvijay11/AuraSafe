## Empowering Women’s Safety Through Technology

### Background of the Innovation
Women’s safety has become a global issue, with alarming increases in incidents of harassment, assault, and violence. According to studies, 97% of women have faced unsafe situations, but in many cases, they cannot alert anyone in real-time due to the lack of proper safety tools. 

Current safety solutions are either inefficient or require manual intervention, which may not always be possible during emergencies. 

### Our Focus
Addressing these critical gaps through a combination of innovative hardware and software for real-time protection and support.

## Summary of the Invention
AuraSafe is an integrated safety system that combines wearable technology with a powerful web platform. Our hardware solution includes a safety gadget equipped with GPS, GSM, and sound sensors, designed to send automatic alerts when activated. 

The web platform enables:
- **Real-time tracking**
- **Emergency alerts to trusted contacts**
- **Dashboard to manage and monitor user location**

This dual-layer protection ensures that women can access help quickly, even if they are unable to physically reach out.

## Detailed Explanation of AuraSafe
**AuraSafe** refers to a system designed for safety, security, and protection, leveraging technology to create a protective "aura" around an individual. 

### Key Features
1. **Wearable Device**
   - Ensures personal safety by alerting emergency contacts or authorities in dangerous situations.
   
2. **SOS Live Location Tracking System**
   - Integrated into mobile devices or wearable technology, this feature allows users to send emergency alerts along with their real-time location to designated contacts.

### How It Works
#### 1. Activation of SOS Alert
- The user activates the SOS function by pressing the dedicated **SOS button** on the device.
- The button must be pressed for **3 to 5 seconds** to activate.
- Upon activation, the device starts collecting and broadcasting the user’s location in real-time.

#### 2. Location Detection
- The device determines the user’s exact location using **GPS**.
- If GPS signals are weak (e.g., indoors), the system may also use:
  - **Wi-Fi networks**
  - **Cell tower triangulation**
  - **Bluetooth signals**
- The system continuously tracks the user's movement and updates the location in real time.

#### 3. Sending Live Location
- We are using a **GPS/GPRS module** that supports **2G SIMs only**.
- The system transmits the location via **SMS services** to designated contacts.
- The user’s location is sent as:
  - **Google Maps link**
  - **Real-time app interface support**

#### 4. Communication with Emergency Contacts
- The system **initiates a phone call** to emergency contacts after sending the SOS alert.
- If the SOS button is pressed for more than **5 seconds**, the system automatically starts a call.
- **Two-way communication** is enabled through an inbuilt microphone, allowing the user to call for help.
